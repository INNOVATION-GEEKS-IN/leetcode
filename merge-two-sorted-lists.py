# URL : https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

# Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
# Example 2:

# Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
# Output: []
# Example 3:

# Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        l3 = ListNode()
